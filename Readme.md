## Project 1 - Serial Recall Experiment




## Project 2 - Free Recall Experiment
### ToDo
- [x] Make a GUI
- [x] Make a random number generator between 1-99
- [x] Make a random serial
- [x] Make a speed timer
- [x] Make a pattern memory tile.
- [x] Make a checker for first and last serial number, to see errors rate
- [x] Make a logger, that logs error rate and other things in a csv file.

### Update (Sequential Reveal)
- The serial is now revealed one number at a time instead of all at once.
- In Normal mode: each number is shown for 3 seconds before moving to the next.
- In Speed mode: each number duration follows the schedule 5s ×5 rounds, 3s ×5 rounds, 1s ×5 rounds.
- In MemoryPattern mode: the serial is also shown sequentially (3 seconds per number) before the pattern grid appears.



# Data
- Confidence Interval
- Histogram
- Graph over speedup
